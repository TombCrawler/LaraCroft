The stable run on this game is on intelliJ, and hit the `Play` button
right above the corner located next to the bug icon to compile and run at the same time.
I get errors when I try to do so in terminal window such as javac Main.java or java Main which do not work.

<br>
The control keys are 
<br>
W = up
<br>
A = left
<br>
S = down 
<br>
D = right
<br>
Enter = Talk to other characters, and finish the conversation

Rule:<br>
Collect keys to open each door to find the relic of Ancient Egypt!
<br>Pick up the gun to speed up! (these features currently disabled)
